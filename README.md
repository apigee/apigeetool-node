# <a name="installation"></a>Installation

`apigeetool` is a Node.js module and you can install it using npm:

`npm install -g apigeetool`

*NOTE*: The `-g` option places the apigeetool command in your PATH. On "\*nix"-based machines, `sudo` may be required with the `-g` option. If you do not use `-g`, then you need to add the apigeetool command to your PATH manually. Typically, the `-g` option places modules in: `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/apigee-127` on *nix-based machines.

# <a name="whatyouneed"></a>What you need to know about apigeetool

You must have an account on Apigee Edge to perform any `apigeetool` functions. These functions include:

* deploying an API proxy to Edge,
* undeploying an API proxy from Edge,
* deploying Node.js apps to Edge,
* listing deployed API proxies on Edge,
* retrieving deployed proxies and apps from Edge,
* deleting proxy definitions from Edge, and
* retreiving log messages from Node.js apps deployed to Edge.
* create or delete an API product in Edge
* create or delete a Developer in Edge
* create or delete a Developer Application in Edge
* create or delete a Cache resource in Edge

You need to be familiar with basic concepts and features of Apigee Edge such as API proxies, organizations, and environments.

For more information, refer to the [Apigee Edge docs](http://apigee.com/docs/).

## <a name="deploynodeapp"></a>deploynodeapp

Deploys a Node.js app to Apigee Edge as an API proxy. With your Node.js app deployed to Edge, you can take advantage of Edge features like security, quotas, caching, analytics, trace tool, and more.

#### Examples

Deploys a Node.js app to Apigee Edge.

    apigeetool deploynodeapp -u sdoe@apigee.com -o sdoe -e test -n 'Test Node App 2' -d . -m app.js -b /node2

Deploys a Node.js app to both the default (HTTP) and secure (HTTPS) virtual hosts.

    apigeetool deploynodeapp -u sdoe@apigee.com -o sdoe -e test -n 'Test Node App 2' -d . -m app.js -b /node2 -v default,secure

#### Required parameters

The following parameters are required. However, if any are left unspecified
on the command line, and if apigeetool is running in an interactive shell,
then apigeetool will prompt for them.

For example, if you do not specify a password using "-p", apigeetool will
prompt for the password on the command line.

See [Common Parameters](#commonargs) for a list of additional parameters, including
the "-u" and "-p" parameters for username and password, and the "-o" parameter
for organization name, all of which are required.

`--environments  -e`  
(required) The name(s) of the environment(s) to deploy to (comma-delimited).  

#### Optional parameters

`--api   -n`  
(optional) The name of the API proxy. The name of the API proxy must be unique within an organization. The characters you are allowed to use in the name are restricted to the following: `A-Z0-9._\-$ %`. If not specified, will attempt to use name from package.json.

`--base-path -b`  
(optional) The base path of the API proxy. For example, for this API proxy, the base path is `/example-proxy`: `http://myorg-test.apigee.net/example-proxy/resource1`.

`--directory -d`  
(optional) The path to the root directory of the API proxy on your local system. Will attempt to use current directory is none is specified.

`--import-only   -i`  
(optional) Imports the API proxy to Apigee Edge but does not deploy it.

`--main  -m`  
(optional) The Node.js file you want to be the main file. If not specified, will attempt to use main from package.json.

`--preserve-policies -P`  
(optional) If specified, the highest revision of the existing proxy will be downloaded and the node code in your directory will be overlayed upon it to create a resulting proxy that contains both any existing policies and the node code in the directory. If there is no existing revision, this option will have no effect. 

`--resolve-modules   -R`  
(optional) If the API proxy includes Node.js modules (e.g., in a `node_modules` directory), this option updates them on Apigee Edge without uploading them from your system. Basically, it's like running "npm install" on Apigee Edge in the root directory of the API proxy bundle.  

`--upload-modules    -U`  
(optional) If specified, uploads Node.js modules from your system to Apigee Edge rather than resolving the modules directly on Apigee Edge (the default behavior).

`--virtualhosts  -v`  
(optional) A comma-separated list of virtual hosts that the deployed app will use. The two most common options are `default` and `secure`. The `default` option is always HTTP and `secure` is always HTTPS. By default, `apigeetool deploynodeapp` uses `default,secure`.

## <a name="deployproxy"></a>deployproxy

    apigeetool deployproxy  -u sdoe@example.com -o sdoe  -e test -n example-proxy -d .

#### Required parameters

The following parameters are required. However, if any are left unspecified

## <a name="fetchproxy"></a>fetchproxy

Fetches a deployed API proxy or Node.js application from Apigee Edge. The
result will be a ZIP file that contains the contents of the entire
proxy.

Regardless of whether "deployproxy" or "deploynodeapp" is used to deploy the
proxy or app, the result of "fetchproxy" will always be a ZIP file that
represents an API proxy. The resulting proxy may be "unzipped" and
re-deployed using "deployproxy."

#### Example

Fetch the deployed proxy named "example-proxy".

    apigeetool fetchproxy -u sdoe@example.com -o sdoe -n example-proxy -r 1

#### Required parameters

The following parameters are required. However, if any are left unspecified
on the command line, and if apigeetool is running in an interactive shell,
then apigeetool will prompt for them.

See [Common Parameters](#commonargs) for a list of additional parameters, including
the "-u" and "-p" parameters for username and password, and the "-o" parameter
for organization name, all of which are required.

`--api  -n`  
(required) The name of the API proxy or app to undeploy.

`--revision  -r`
(required) Specifies the revision to retrieve.

#### Optional parameters

`--file -f`
(optional) The name of the file to write as the result. If not specified,
then the file name will be the same as the name passed to the "name"
parameter.

## <a name="delete"></a>delete

Delete all revisions of a proxy from Apigee Edge.

It is an error to delete a proxy that still has deployed revisions. Revisions
must be undeployed using "undeploy" before this command may be used.

#### Example

Delete the proxy named "example-proxy".

    apigeetool delete -u sdoe@example.com -o sdoe -n example-proxy

#### Required parameters

The following parameters are required. However, if any are left unspecified
on the command line, and if apigeetool is running in an interactive shell,
then apigeetool will prompt for them.

See [Common Parameters](#commonargs) for a list of additional parameters, including
the "-u" and "-p" parameters for username and password, and the "-o" parameter
for organization name, all of which are required.

`--api  -n`  
(required) The name of the API proxy or app to undeploy.

## <a name="getlogs"></a>getlogs

Retrieve the last set of log records from a Node.js application deployed to Apigee Edge.

The resulting log files will be written directly to standard output. Each is prefixed with:

* A timestamp, in UTC by default
* An indication of whether the log record came from standard output or standard error
* A unique identifier of the server where the log was generated.

Since Apigee Edge, by default, deploys each Node.js application on at least two
different servers, most applications will see at least two sets of logs. These are
sorted in time stamp order.

The log records from this command come from a cache inside Apigee Edge that retains
the last 500 lines of log output from each server. The cache is a circular buffer,
so older messages will be discarded when it fills up.

By default, the last set of log records will be pulled and written to standard output. However, if the
"-f" option is used, then "apigeetool" will poll Edge for new log records and append them to standard
output, in the manner of "tail -f". (By default, the tool polls every
five seconds).

For example, a set of log records might look like this:
